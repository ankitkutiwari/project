            <h3 class="card-title">Details of the Project</h3>
            <p class="card-text">The Website is of Virtual Lab related to Chemical Engineering's subject "Particle And
                Fluid Particle Processing". The Project's front-end has been designed with HTML, CSS, Javascript and
                back-end with Javascript, Nodejs, Expressjs and Pug template.</p>
            <p class="card-text">The Navbar consists of Home, About Us, Experiment's Dropdown, Contact.</p>
            <p class="card-text">On Home Page, we provided the List of Experiments and on top of the page with
                background image we had given the introduction related to the website.</p>
            <p class="card-text">On About Us Page, we mentioned about Our College and Our Team who worked on the
                website.</p>
            <p class="card-text">On Contact Page; we ask the Name of the user who is contacting with us, their Email
                Address, Contact No.and the Query/Message they want to ask or they want to give.</p>
            <p>In Experiment's Dropdown all the experiments has been mentioned, user can chooose accordingly the
                experiment on which they want to go for. The particular Experiment page has been designed as that in the
                left side there is Aim, Apparatus Required, Theory, Procedure etc which has been made clickable so that
                you can directly go on that context. To get the observation of the experiment from the users we had
                provided input bar to get the input from the user. Now to get the result from the observation that the
                user had provided, we made a clickable Submit button. So after submitting they will be redirected to
                Output Page where they will get the output in the table form and the calculation which has been done to
                get that output will also be visible on that page. In some experiments, graphs are also there so that
                has also been made to be visible.</p>
